This is my first blog post since beginning Flat Iron's online Software Engineering program so I thought I would give a bit of background about myself, why I'm taking the course and where I see my life going following its completion. 

In all honesty I didn't see myself going down the path to becoming a programmer. Since univeristy I had focussed on one thing and one thing alone, becoming an Officer in the Royal Navy. Unfortunately, after years of trying to make it onto the course, it was no longer on the table. I was at a cross roads with my life and I decided to sit down and figure out what I wanted and how to achieve it. 

It came down to three basic points: 
1. I wanted to learn a transferrable skill.
2. I wanted to have the option to work anywhere in the world (with decent WIFI). 
3. I wanted to do something intellectually stimulating. 

I've always had it in the back of my mind that being able to program would be something I would enjoy, and it ticked all of my boxes when deciding what I wanted to with my life. I knew about Flat Iron School from my time working in the same building as their London Campus, so I applied, Interviewed and was accepted. Happy days!

At the time I am writing this the world has changed drastically. More than 2 billion people globally (including myself) are in lockdown due to COVID 19. It is a very strange time to be alive. I think the novelty of living through a historical event has already begun to wear thin. On the plus side, there is nothing else to do besides help out on the farm (not a bad place to quarantine) and code. So that's what I'm going to do. Make the most of this strange situation, try and stay healthy and learn to code. Who know's I may have even finished the course by the time this all blows over (lets hope it doesn't last as long as they say it might).

With the world changing from the corona virus it is hard to know what the future will look like, and therefore hard to plan exactly what I'd like to do after graduating. A job would be nice! I think maybe I'll look at moving into the BENELUX region (I am going to try and sneak in before the government remembers about BREXIT. Luckily they're suitably distracted.). The truth is I am open to suggestions. Thank god for the careers service at Flat Iron amirite!

Thats all for now.
